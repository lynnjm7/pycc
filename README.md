Credit Card Validation Toy
==========================
This is a very simple program to toy around with the Luhn checksum 
algorithm and tinker with credit card number validation. 

This project is not intended to be a production library or a
production tool. It is implemented as a simple command line utility
and determines if a provided credit card number is valid and tries
to match the credit card number against a handful of known credit
card issuer schemes.

# Usage
This tool is very simple to use. It only accepts a single positional 
command line argument. 
```
./main.py <credit_card_number>
```

If you would like to see more information on this you can use 
```
./main.py --help 
```
This will output some detailed help information for this tool.
